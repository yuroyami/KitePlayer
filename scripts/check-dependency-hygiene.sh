# Keeps dependency resolution predictable: same inputs in, same artifacts out.
#
# Why this shape and not a lockfile. The plan's row offered a choice, so both were tried.
#
#   Artifact checksum verification (gradle/verification-metadata.xml) does not fit this build yet.
#   Generating it here produced 486 components from a SINGLE jvm compile, and the very next task
#   failed with "Dependency verification failed for configuration ':detachedConfiguration1'":
#   Kotlin/Native and the Node setup resolve through detached configurations that the generator
#   never saw. Worse, CI runs on macOS, Linux and Windows, and each host resolves its own toolchain
#   artifacts. A file written on one machine cannot carry the other two, and there is no way to
#   produce their halves from here. Turning it on would redden every CI job on two OSes to buy
#   verification on one. The row that records this stays open with that finding attached.
#
#   Version lockfiles would mostly restate gradle/libs.versions.toml, which already pins every
#   direct version, and they fight this project's preference for staying on current releases.
#
# So this checks the things that actually leak, all of which are true in the tree today and none
# of which anything stops going wrong tomorrow. Each rule is a real failure mode, not a style
# preference:
#
#   1. A dynamic version in the catalog. `1.+` or `latest.release` means two checkouts of the same
#      commit can build different bytes, and the difference shows up as a bug nobody can reproduce.
#   2. A dependency coordinate written inline in a build file. It bypasses the catalog, so the
#      version is invisible to anyone reading the one file that is supposed to list them all.
#   3. A `repositories { }` block in a module. Settings owns resolution for the whole build; a
#      module that adds its own can pull the same coordinate from somewhere else entirely.
#   4. mavenLocal outside its opt-in guard. When it is on it is consulted FIRST and wins SILENTLY,
#      which settings.gradle.kts explains at length. An unguarded one undoes that whole argument.
#   5. A plain-http repository or distribution URL. Anyone on the path can serve their own bytes.
#   6. A wrapper with no distributionSha256Sum, which is the only thing pinning the Gradle build
#      itself.
#
# NOT checked here, because CI already does it better: the wrapper JAR's own checksum.
# gradle/actions/setup-gradle validates it on every job by default, against Gradle's published
# list of known-good jars. That list needs the network and goes stale in a checked-in copy, so
# this script does not keep one. The two sibling repositories carry wrapper jars with DIFFERENT
# checksums, which is expected and not a finding: the jar comes from whichever Gradle ran
# `wrapper`, not from the distribution it points at.
#
#   ./scripts/check-dependency-hygiene.sh             # must PASS
#   ./scripts/check-dependency-hygiene.sh --falsify   # plants each violation in turn, must FAIL
